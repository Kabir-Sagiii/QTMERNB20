<h1>Hyper Text Markup Language ( HTML )</h1>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
  prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
  In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
  system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
  software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer
  Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project
  was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
  listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is
  the first entry.[4]
